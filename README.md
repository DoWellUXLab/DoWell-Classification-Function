# DoWell-Classification of Big Data 

Welcome to the Classification API! The Classification API is a comprehensive tool that enables users to classify a large set of data efficiently by using three classification methods which are - 
1. ```Non-Hierarchial Classification```
2. ```Hierarchial Classification```
3. ```Tree Structure```

It provides a reliable and high-performance solution for the classification of data.

## Features

The Classification API offers the following key features:

1. ```Non-Hierarchial Classification``` - this feature enables the users to classify the data by selecting and setting the basket order by their own choice. 
2. ```Hierarchial Classification``` - this feature enables the users to classify the data by following a basket order which is already being set by the project owner.
3. ```Tree Structure Classification``` - this feature enables the users to classify the data by following the properties of a data tree, where baskets and items are arranged in the form of parent nodes and child nodes.
